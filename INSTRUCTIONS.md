Please write your solution in Python.

Please use a git repository

- We ask that you make use of more than 1 commit
- Please send us a link to your private repository and add the following as collaborators:

  - @mbeveridge-resilient
  - @rdunn-resilient
  - @dseaton-resilient
  - @srana-resilient

Please feel free to reach us out if you have any questions/doubts.

## Context

In the ML teams, one of our typical activities might look like the following:
- ingest input data
- enrich with various external/internal information
- present the transformed data

This tech test is a simplified sample from one of our real systems.

## Task

Build a program which from two sources of data (calls and network operators) generates a CSV report.

### Input: calls

The first source is a JSON document containing phone calls:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "call",
      "id": "2c4fae60-cf43-4f27-869e-a9ed8b0ca25b",
      "attributes": {
        "date": "2020-10-12T07:20:50.52Z",
        "riskScore": 0.431513435443,
        "number": "+44123456789",
        "greenList": true,
        "redList": false
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "call",
      "id": "8f1b1354-26d2-4e16-9582-9156a0d9a5de",
      "attributes": {
        "date": "2019-10-12T07:20:50.52Z",
        "riskScore": 0.123444,
        "number": "+44123456789",
        "greenList": false,
        "redList": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:
| field                | type   | description                                                    | example                                |
|----------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| type                 | string | always "call"                                                  | "call"                                 |
| id                   | string | UUID                                                           | "8f1b1354-26d2-4e16-9582-9156a0d9a5de" |
| attributes.date      | string | UTC date in RFC 3339 format                                    | "2019-10-12T07:20:50.52Z"              |
| attributes.riskScore | float  | number between 0.0 (not risky)  and 1.0 (potential fraud call) | 0.1231351351435                        |
| attributes.number    | string | phone number in E164 format                                    | +4467464311354153                      |
| attributes.greenList | bool   | the call is not risky regardless of the risk score             | true                                   |
| attributes.redList   | bool   | the call is fraud regardless of the risk score                 | false                                  |

### Input: operators

The second source is a JSON document containing phone operators:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "operator",
      "id": "2c4fae60-cf43-4f27-869e-a9ed8b0ca25b",
      "attributes": {
        "prefix": "1000",
        "operator": "Vodafone"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "operator",
      "id": "8f1b1354-26d2-4e16-9582-9156a0d9a5de",
      "attributes": {
        "prefix": "2000",
        "operator": "EE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:
| field               | type   | description                    | example                                |
|---------------------|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| type                | string | always "operator"              | "operator"                             |
| id                  | string | UUID                           | "8f1b1354-26d2-4e16-9582-9156a0d9a5de" |
| attributes.prefix   | string | prefix range - see below       | "2000"                                 |
| attributes.operator | string | the name of the phone operator | "Vodafone"                             |

If the prefix range is "2000", it means that a national number starting with that prefix belongs to that phone operator:
- `+442143999888`: belongs to the operator, it can be broken down as `+44-2143-999888` and `2143` is in the range 2000-2999
- `+448423666777`: does not belong to the operator, it can be broken down as `+44-8423-666777` and `8423` is not in the range 2000-2999

### Output

The program might generate the following CSV from the 2 sources of data (this CSV sample is *not* linked to the 2 JSON examples from above):
```csv
id,date,number,operator,riskScore
b9db7910-004a-48a9-9fa3-718662b40bf7,2018-10-12,+441234567890,Vodafone,0.0
84effcca-39aa-424c-961f-34ad09074b42,2018-10-13,+447897949132,Swisstelecom,0.2
ffde08d9-6999-48ec-a6d9-9cf1dd28089e,2019-10-13,+449876460460,Unknown,1.0
db48da6c-6cb8-43d5-9637-5906b295fd20,2020-11-12,+449494101010,EE,0.3
911ea345-c58c-4688-bd9a-725263a1540b,2023-11-12,Withheld,Unknown,0.9
cd62116b-9e31-41fd-a7e5-018d7a7d6533,2023-11-12,Withheld,Unknown,0.5
```

Where:
- `id`: the call id
- `date`: the date of the call with the `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `number`: the call number
- `operator`: the operator obtained by a lookup in the operators JSON data source based on the number phone
- `riskScore`: the presented risk score (see the rules below)

The rules for the risk score calculation are:
- rounded half up to 1 DP (i.e. half way values or above are rounded up, values below half way are rounded down) 
  - e.g. 0.41 rounds to 0.4, 0.45 rounds to 0.5, 0.48 rounds to 0.5   
- if on the green list, the value is 0.0
- if on the red list, the value is 1.0
- being on the green list has precedence on the red list (e.g. if a call is on the green list and the red list, the risk score will be 0.0)

Misc rules:
- if the operator cannot be found, "Unknown" should be displayed as the operator field
- if the number is absent, "Withheld" should be displayed as the number field
- the calls are ordered by ascending date

## What we expect

- clean code practices
- relevant usage of software design patterns
- relevant test coverage
- simple README to explain how to run your program
- regular committing to see your thoughts process

## Input data

- the calls JSON data file: `data/calls.json`
- the operators JSON data file: `data/operators.json`
